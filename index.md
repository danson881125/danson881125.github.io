(Began as an undergraduate research assistant) Supervised by Prof. Dawn Song and collaborated with postdoctoral researcher Min Du on research projects related to deep learning and security.

Lifelong anomaly detection through unlearning:
• Developed LSTM models to analyze system log files.
• Maintained a small memory set of labeled data to prevent catastrophic forgetting.
• Developed a process that is much easier and faster than retraining the system from scratch.
• The experiment results show a reduction of up to 77.3% false positives and up to 76.6% false negatives on real anomaly detection dataset (Paper presented in CCS'19).

Adversarial enhancement for community detection in networks:
• Designs multi-objective fitness function and auto-threshold to solve the resolution limit problem and achieve consensus partition.
• Evaluated on existing community detection algorithms and the improvement of performance was 10%-30%.
• Adversarial experiments show that proposed methods can achieve stronger defense against community detection deception (Paper presented in arXiv).

Time-aware gradient attack on dynamic network link prediction:
• Utilized the gradient information generated by DDNE across different snapshots to rewire a few links and consider the dynamic natures of real-world systems.
• Implemented TGA in two ways: one is based on traversal search and greedy search.
• Evaluated the data from real-world scenarios and the comprehensive experiments show the attack success rate has increased by 20%-40% using TGA. (Paper presented in arXiv).

NDSGD: A practical method to improve robustness of deep learning model on noisy dataset:
• Used noisy data clipping and group to reduce the influence of noisy data.
• Added robustness factors to reduce the oscillation of the loss curve and tune the hyper-parameters to learn optimal models.
• Evaluated the celebrated datasets and the performance surpassed the state-of-the-art.

Collaborated with PhD student Xiangyu Yue (Advisor: Prof. Kurt Keutzer) on research projects related to deep learning.

Domain Adaptation for Road-object Segmentation:
• Developed a semantic-based scene method which enables to realize 3D-object segmentation from a point-wise label map, using a domain-adaptation training method to reduce the distribution gap between synthetic data and real data so as to enhance the performance of model.

Autonomous driving with SqueezeNet and CNN:
• Developed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in TensorFlow to classify images.
• Conducted image segmentation on KITTI dataset and model training based on SqueezeNet and CNN, aiming to collect data from GTA-V (an action-adventure video game) and further using this dataset to train CNN model for autonomous driving.
